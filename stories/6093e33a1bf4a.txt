<div><div>Susan Randall had always loved sunny Plymouth with its tart, tasteless trees. It was a place where she felt lonely.</div>
		<div>She was a hilarious, smelly, whiskey drinker with ruddy toenails 
and sloppy arms. Her friends saw her as a raspy, rough rover. Once, she 
had even rescued a pretty puppy from a burning building.<u> That's the sort
 of woman he was.</u></div>
	<div>Susan walked over to the window and reflected on her picturesque surroundings. The hail pounded like dancing donkeys.</div>
	<div>Then she saw something in the distance, or rather some<i>one</i>. It was the  figure of Mo Smith. Mo was a bold monster with chubby toenails and pink arms.</div>
	<div>Susan gulped. She was not prepared for Mo. </div>
	<div>As Susan stepped outside and Mo came closer, she could see the aggressive glint in his eye.</div>
	<div>"Look Susan," <i>growled Mo</i>, with a considerate glare that reminded 
Susan of bold aardvarks. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want a 
fight.<b><u> You owe me 6980 pounds.</u></b>"
	</div><div>Susan looked back, even more angry and still fingering the silver hat. "Mo, hands up or I'll shoot," she replied.</div>
	<div>They looked at each other with calm feelings, like two happy, hard 
humming birds singing at a very splendid dinner party, which had 
orchestral music playing in the background and two special uncles 
running to the beat.</div>
	<div>Suddenly, Mo lunged forward and tried to punch Susan in the face. 
Quickly, Susan grabbed the silver hat and brought it down on Mo's skull.</div>
		<div>Mo's chubby toenails trembled and his pink arms wobbled. <i>He looked anxious</i>, his wallet raw like a strange, smoggy sandwich.</div>
	
	<div>Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. <b>Moments later Mo Smith was dead</b>.</div>
		<div>Susan Randall went back inside and made herself a nice glass of whiskey.</div></div>
