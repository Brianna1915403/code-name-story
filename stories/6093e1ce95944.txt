<div><div>Charlotte Ferguson had always loved deserted Bangkok with its pongy, plain parks. It was a place where she felt anxious.</div>
		<div>She was a cowardly, deranged, brandy drinker with fluffy legs and 
fluffy ankles. Her friends saw her as a barbecued, bad brute. Once, she 
had even made a cup of tea for an enthusiastic blind person. That's the 
sort of woman he was.</div>
	<div>Charlotte walked over to the window and reflected on her backward surroundings. The rain hammered like hopping ostriches.</div>
	<div>Then she saw something in the distance, or rather some<i>one</i>. It was the  figure of Tony Bond. Tony was an energetic dolphin with skinny legs and ginger ankles.</div>
	<div><i>Charlotte gulped. She was not prepared for Tony.</i> </div>
	<div>As Charlotte stepped outside and Tony came closer, she could see the tense smile on his face.</div>
	<div>"<b>I</b> am here because<b> I </b>want a resolution," Tony bellowed, in a hungry 
tone. He slammed his fist against Charlotte's chest, with the force of 
1149 owls. "I frigging love you, Charlotte Ferguson."</div>
	<div>Charlotte looked back, even more ecstatic and still fingering the tiny sandwich. "<b>Tony, I don't have the money,</b>" she replied.</div>
	<div>They looked at each other with ambivalent feelings, like two many, 
magnificent monkeys bouncing at a very wild bar mitzvah, which had indie
 music playing in the background and two vile uncles jogging to the 
beat.</div>
	<div>Suddenly, Tony lunged forward and tried to punch Charlotte in the 
face. Quickly, Charlotte grabbed the tiny sandwich and brought it down 
on Tony's skull.</div>
		<div>Tony's skinny legs trembled and his ginger ankles wobbled. He looked lonely, his body raw like a klutzy, knobbly knife.</div>
	
	<div>Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Tony Bond was dead.</div>
		<div>Charlotte Ferguson went back inside and made herself a nice glass of brandy.</div></div>
