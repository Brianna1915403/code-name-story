<div><div class='blurb'><div>A long, long time ago in a wobbly, wobbly galaxy...</div>

<div>After leaving the cold planet Frabenesh, a group of youths fly toward
 a distant speck. The speck gradually resolves into a crowded, space 
house.</div>

<div>Civil war strikes the galaxy, which is ruled by Dan DeVito, a dirty alien capable of decadence and even assassination.</div>

<div>Terrified, a noisy troll known as Garth Vader flees the Empire,  with his protector, Cuthbert Pigeon.</div>

<div>They head for Exeter on the planet Solaris. When they finally arrive,
 a fight breaks out. Pigeon uses his wobbly rifle to defend  Garth.</div> 

<div>Pigeon and Troll Garth decide it's time to leave Solaris and  steal a boat to shoot their way out.</div>

<div>They encounter a tribe of girls. Pigeon is attacked and the troll is captured by the girls and taken back to Exeter.</div>

<div>Pigeon must fight to save Troll Garth but when he accidentally 
unearths a chilly sandwich, the entire future of the wobbly, cold galaxy
 is at stake.</div></div></div>
