school.</div>

<div>Civil war strikes the galaxy, which is ruled by Joshua Gloop, an ample pixie capable of theft and even mutilation.</div>

<div>Terrified, a tender zombie known as Graham Bond flees the Empire,  with his protector, Maud Raymond.</div>

<div>They head for Manchester on the planet Dune. When they finally 
arrive, a fight breaks out. Raymond uses her hairy gun to defend  
Graham.</div> 

<div>Raymond and Zombie Graham decide it's time to leave Dune and  steal a van to shoot their way out.</div>
